This post lays down an insight into how swift and scripting together can help in resolving many day to day problems as a programmer who works primarily on swift language.

# What is scripting
Scripting can be defined as a program that is usually intended to automate certain task(s). A primary focus of a scripting language does not build the application but might provide behavior to an existing application.
## Programming vs Scripting
Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted.

# Why swift-scripting
As a programmer who primarily works with swift, scripting in swift itself would mean:
1. less context switching, less hurdles to overcome (e.g. if they had to use python script, then they might have to understand how to divide/join arrays. But if this needs to be done in swift then they might already be familiar with it or would be easier to learn)
2. Getting to use libraries that one has already worked with, for example, Foundation, URLSession, Files etc.
3. One can also use shared code between the scripts and the application itself, i.e. using one's own custom libraries. 

# Getting started with swift scripting

# Using Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) to create an executable product or swift script

# Example: "vcommit"
